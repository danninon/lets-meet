Motivation
Managing pull requests is a time-consuming task that can be a major bottleneck in the software development process. It's easy to get bogged down in the details of writing pull request messages, which can slow down the entire project and make it difficult to stay on track. With PR0B0T, we aim to solve this problem and streamline the pull request process.

By automating the generation and injection of pull request messages, PR0B0T frees up developers' time, allowing them to focus on what they do best – writing great code. The platform's advanced technology ensures that each message is tailored to the specific needs of the user, saving them valuable time and effort. With PR0B0T, developers can spend less time on administrative tasks and more time on the work that matters most.

Architecture
The project is comprised of two main components:

Server:
GitHubHandler: interacts with the GitHub API using Python to retrieve necessary data.
